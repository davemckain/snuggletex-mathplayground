NOTE: This gets filtered to produce a version suitable for deploying
into a running Tomcat, using the build/webapp as docBase and with
reloadable='true'.

The line below MUST contain the String 'Context path' so that this
information can be added in safely (and once only)!

-->
<Context docBase="/phys/linux/dmckain/Projects/MathPlayground/build/webapp" reloadable="true" path="@uk.ac.ed.ph.mathplayground.tomcat.context.path@"/>
