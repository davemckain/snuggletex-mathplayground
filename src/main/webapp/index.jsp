<h1>Math Playground Home</h1>

<p>
  The SnuggleTeX Math Playground is a slightly random showcase
  of demos, experiments and code snippets relating to "maths on the web".
</p>
<p>
  It is primarily intended to be an incubation area to try out and share new
  ideas that might be useful in other projects, such as:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/snuggletex/">SnuggleTeX</a>
    (The MathPlayground showcases some improvements to the "up-conversion" or
    "semantic enrichment" ideas, as well as updating its web output templates
    to accommodate recent significant advances like MathJax. These new ideas
    are scheduled to appear in SnuggleTeX 1.3.)
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www2.ph.ed.ac.uk/MathAssessEngine">MathAssessEngine</a>
    (We hope to widen browser support and improving the process for inputting
    and making sense of simple mathematical expressions.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Hopefully some of the ideas and sketches demonstrated here might also be useful
  to other people and other projects, which I would be interested to learn about.
